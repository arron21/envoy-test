# envoy-test

This is a single responsive web page

# Instructions

Pull the repo
run gulp watch

I know the node_modules shouldn't be on github, that will get fixed later.

The gulp build is not done yet

Ideal finished product would have if time allowed:
-all slides perfectly responsive and readable
-a better mobile nav
-a more robust slider with touch support
-actual twitter integration
-a completed gulp build script
-more optimized SCSS that better uses Bourbon


Personal Notes:
>This is the first time I've used Bourbon... 
>but it certainly will not be the last!
>Gulp gets better every time I use it.
